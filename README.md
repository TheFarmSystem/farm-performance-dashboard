# Farm Dashboard (Shad starter)

Mobile-first client dashboard starter built with Next.js (App Router), Tailwind, and ECharts.

## Run locally
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 and click "Open Demo Dashboard".

## Notes
- This repo intentionally avoids auth for MVP (you can add signed links later).
- Next steps: add ingestion endpoints for Blast CSV + Rapsodo PDF and a swipeable source viewer.
